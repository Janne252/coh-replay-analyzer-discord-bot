Source code contributions via pull requests will be enabled once the project has reached a certain level of robustness.
A refactor/partial rewrite is in the works including an in-house replay parser and improved unit testing.

**Some design concepts, certainly not set in stone**
 - The bot is designed to be as simple as possible. It should not require persistent data storage on the machine it runs on. 
 - The resources that the bot utilizes, like Company of Heroes 2 assets, should be easy to update. See the data-generator sub-project as an example of this.
